# coyote-travelog

<i>coyote travelog</i> is an ongoing book composed of found text from the streets and spaces of New York City (2017–present).<br>
<br>
In her book, <i>Geographies of Writing: Inhabiting Places and Encountering Difference</i> (2004), Nedra Reynolds writes: “Although geographers do not have a monopoly on ‘seeing’ as a research practice, they might suggest that understanding spatial and cultural difference begins on the ground, for example, by walking through neighborhoods.” For the last three years, I have scanned the streets and spaces of New York City for text that might help me better understand the social, cultural, and political realities and conditions of the vast and enigmatic metropolis. <i>coyote travelog</i> is a record of my wandering. It is a textual portrait of the city, an urban memoir composed of found language (<i>language found while walking</i>).<br>
<br>
My intention is not to “exhaust” a place within the city, but rather, to find materials that “articulate place”—text I call “emblematic language.” I collect (and by “collect” I mean take photos with my smartphone) things like street signs, store awnings, graffiti and stickers, flyers on community boards, menus, inscriptions on monuments, WiFi network names, wanted posters, haikus on bathroom stalls, phone numbers above glory holes in bathroom stalls, giant advertisements in Times Square, storefront church names in Harlem and in the Bronx, foreclosure notices, cardboard signs of people in the streets, and signs at protests. I believe this language and the corresponding metadata capture the zeitgeist of this tumultuous moment—a time characterized by the intersection of widely differing ideologies. This is a conceptual writing, an ambulatory poetry of place, that at once says something about New York City and evokes the world beyond it. <br>
