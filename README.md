# coyote-travelogue

<i>coyote travelougue<i> is an in progress manuscript composed of select text I have found while walking around New York City.
The text is from a multitude of sourcesâ€”bodega awnings, information signage, graffiti, ssids, to name a few. Corresponding
geolocative information is also included, as well as information regarding the community in which the text was found. I plan on
<i>coyote travelougue<i> being incoroprated into my dissertation in some form. More information to come.
