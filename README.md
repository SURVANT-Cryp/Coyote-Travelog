# coyote-travelogue

<i>coyote travelogue</i> is an in-progress experimental book composed of found text from the streets and spaces of New York City (2017–present).<br>
<br>
In her book, <i>Geographies of Writing: Inhabiting Places and Encountering Difference</i> (2004), Nedra Reynolds states that “Although geographers do not have a monopoly on ‘seeing’ as a research practice, they might suggest that understanding spatial and cultural difference begins on the ground, for example, by walking through neighborhoods.” For the last three years, I have scanned the streets and spaces of New York City for text that might help me better understand the social, cultural, and political realities and conditions of the vast and enigmatic metropolis. <i>coyote travelog</i> is a record of my wandering. It is a textual portrait of the city, an urban memoir composed of found language (<i>language found while walking</i>).<br>

“The crowd is his element, as the air is that of birds and water of fishes. For the perfect flâneur, for the passionate spectator, it is an immense joy to set up house in the heart of the multitude, amid the ebb and flow of movement, in the midst of the fugitive and the infinite. To be away from home and yet to feel oneself everywhere at home; to see the world, to be at the center of the world, and yet to remain hidden from the world.”—Charles Baudelaire, <i>The Painter of Modern Life</i><br>
<br>
“Flânerie is a form of reading the street whereby human faces, displays, windows, cafe terraces, streetcars, automobiles, trees, become so many equally weighted letters which together yield the words, sentences, and pages of a book that is always new.”—Franz Hessel, <i>Walking in Berlin</i><br>
<br>
“You could create a psychogeographic map of a city’s language by a making a dérive from point A to point B, writing down every word your eyes encounter on buildings, signage, parking meters, flyers and so forth. You’d end up with a trove of rich language, myriad in its tones and directives, comprised of peripheral words you’d most likely never paid attention to, such as the fine print on a parking meter.”—Kenneth Goldsmith, <i>Uncreative Writing</i><br>
