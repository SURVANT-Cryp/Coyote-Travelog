# coyote-travelogue

<a href="https://static.tumblr.com/7ggoisn/r2lpwtq0u/coyote_travelogue.pdf"><i>coyote travelogue</i></a> is an in-progress ethnographic surrealist manuscript consisting of text I have found while walking around New York City. 
As of August 2019, I have walked thousands of miles (over 100 neighborhoods) of the city. The text I have collected is from a multitude of sources—information signage, bodega awnings, subway graffiti, ssids, to name a few. Geolocative data and community district information are also included in the manuscript. I plan on
the project being incorporated into my dissertation in some form.<br>
