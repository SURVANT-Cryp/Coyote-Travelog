# coyote-travelogue

<i>coyote travelougue</i> is an in progress manuscript composed of select text I have found while walking around New York City. 
As of August 2019, I have walked thousands of miles through over 100 neighborhoods. The text of<i>coyote travelougue</i> is from a multitude of sourcesâ€”information signage, bodega awnings, subway graffiti, ssids, to name a few. Corresponding
geolocative information is also included, as well as information regarding the community in which the text was found. I plan on
the project being incoroprated into my dissertation in some form. More information to come.
